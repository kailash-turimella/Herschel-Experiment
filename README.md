# Herschel Experiment

## Overview

This project replicates William Herschel's experiment, which demonstrated the existence of infrared radiation. Our device is designed to split white light into its spectrum using prisms and measure the temperatures of different colors of light in real-time. We developed both the hardware and software to ensure accurate measurements and provide a user-friendly interface.

## Objective

- **Design and produce** user-friendly hardware that splits white light into a spectrum and measures the temperature of different colors.
- **Program a GUI** that graphs and compares the temperature measurements of different colors in real time.

## Key Achievements

- **First Place Award**: Advanced Engineering Industry Collaboration Program.
- **Effective Problem-Solving**: Overcame 3D printing challenges, such as stringing and weak infill.
- **Leadership and Team Management**: Led a team of five members, providing regular status reports and motivating team members.
- **Resilience During Pandemic**: Ensured project completion and collaboration despite COVID-19 disruptions.
- **Interactive Software Development**: Created a JavaScript interface for real-time data graphing and comparison.
- **Applied Physics and Engineering**: Accurately calculated prism angles for optimal light dispersion.

## Hardware Components

1. **Prism System**: Utilizes prisms to separate white light into individual colors.
2. **Projector Holder**: Supports and aligns the projector for consistent light output.
3. **Sensor Mobility**: Allows for precise positioning to measure temperatures accurately.
4. **3D Printed Enclosure**: Designed in four parts for smooth printing and assembly.

## Software Components

1. **Data Acquisition (DAQ)**: Converts analog readings from RTD sensors to digital for computer processing.
2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Developed using Visual Studio, displays temperature data and allows users to interact with the experiment.
3. **Calibration Routine**: Ensures sensor accuracy with offset adjustments and calibration modes.

## Systems and Theory

- **Optical Theorem**: Used to calculate the amplitude and scattering of light.
- **Snellâ€™s Law**: Applied to determine the refraction angles of light through prisms, ensuring accurate temperature measurements.
- **Temperature Data**: Demonstrated trends in temperature across different colors, with specific measurements for each color band.

## Project Workflow

1. **Team Formation**: Members assigned based on skill sets.
2. **Design and Documentation**: Procedures and progress tracked using Trello.
3. **Material Selection**: Components like glass prisms and RTD sensors chosen for their reliability.
4. **Prototyping and Testing**: Iterative process to refine hardware and software, ensuring accurate and reliable performance.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Remote Collaboration**: Managed effective communication and progress tracking during online schooling.
- **Learning Curve**: Gained proficiency in Visual Studio and Onshape for software development and mechanical design.
- **3D Printing Issues**: Addressed printing challenges by redesigning parts and optimizing print settings.

## Future Plans

- **Educational Outreach**: Plan to teach students about the experiment and infrared radiation during summer programs.
- **Design Improvements**: Enhance robustness and portability for broader demonstration use.
- **STEM Events**: Set up demonstrations at STEM outreach events to engage and educate the public.
